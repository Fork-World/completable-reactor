# CompletableReactor
CompletableReactor framework makes it easier to create business flows that have concurrently running parts and complex execution branching.

CompletableReactor provides DSL-like builder-style API to describe business flows.

Framework built on top of Fork Join Pool and CompletableFuture API.

## Motivation
[CompletableFuture API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html) 
with [ForkJoinPool](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html) 
provides ability to write asynchronous code. But sometimes business logic not as straight forward as we would like.
This leads to complex thenApply/thenCompose CompletableFuture chains that hard to read and maintain.
Complex business logic with lots of branching and concurrently executing parts hard to describe using regular coding approach
without proper visualization. And best way to represent that branching is graph with nodes.   
CompletableReactor API tries to keep API as simple and possible in same time provides ability to visualize 
code as graph of execution flows.
 
## Concept

### Terms

**Payload** - plain old java object that encapsulate request, response and intermediate computation data required for request processing.  
```java
class MyPayload{
    static class Request {
        String data1;
        int data2;
    }
    static class Response {
        boolean result;
    }
    static class IntermediateData {
        String someData;
    }
    
    final Request request = new Request();
    final Response response = new Request();
    final IntermediateData intermediateData = new IntermediateData();
}
```
or simply
```java
class MyPayload{
    //request parameters
    String data1;
    int data2;
    
    //intermediate data
    String someData;
    
    //execution results
    boolean result;
}
```

**Processor** - service that encapsulates common logic. Usually Processor contains several Handlers.  
```java
@Reactored("MyNiceService description")
class MyNiceService {
    //...
    @Reactored("myNiceHandler documentation")
    CompletableFuture<HanlderResultType> myNiceHandler(String arg1, int arg2) {/*...*/}
    //...
}
```

**Handler** - asynchronous method that takes information from Payload and returns computation result. 
```java
@Reactored("myNiceHandler documentation")
CompletableFuture<HanlderResultType> myNiceHandler(String arg1, int arg2)` 
```

![Alt processor.png](docs/processor.png?raw=true "MergePoint")

**Merger** - synchronous method that takes Handlers computation result and uses it to update Payload
```java
@Reactored("myNiceMerger documentation")
Enum myNiceMerger(Paylaod paylaod, HanlderResultType handlerResult){
    paylaod.getResponse().setData(handlerResult.getData());
    return MyTransition.OK;
}
```
**MergePoint** - graph processing item that uses Merger method to make modification on Payload.
![Alt merge-point.png](docs/merge-point.png?raw=true "MergePoint")

**Transition** - Enum instance that represent transition during flow execution. MergePoint merger returns instance of Enum. 
Outgoing transition will be activated according to this value. If mergere returns status PLAN_B, then all outgoing transitions with 
condition status PLAN_B will be activated and all transitions without PLAN_B status will be marked as dead. For unconditional transitions 
there is no distinct status. That transitions  will be always activated regardless of the merger result.

```java
enum MyTransitions{
    @Reactored("OneWay transition description")
    ONE_WAY,
    @Reactored("AnotherWay transition description")
    ANOTHER_WAY
}
```

### Processor with MergePoint

Processor uses Handler to make asynchronous computation, MergePoint uses Merger to apply Handler computation result on Payload.  
Origin payload is passed to Processors handler, then after handler computation is done origin payload is passed together with handler 
result to merge point. Inside merge point origin payload is modified and became Payload*. Outgoing transitions from merge point pass 
this new Payload* to next nodes.

### MergePoint decision

If all of outgoing transitions from MergePoint have distinct statuses then flow will continue to execute only by one of transitions.  
If MergePoint merger will return FAIL status then execution completes immediately. In case of FIRST status flow will continue and 
Processor2 will be invoked. In case of SECOND status - Processor3
In given example there could be three options:  
* Payload -> Processor1 -> End (if merger returns FAIL status)
* Payload -> Processor1 -> Processor2 -> End (if merger returns FIRST status)
* Payload -> Processor1 -> Processor3 -> End (if merger returns SECOND status)
